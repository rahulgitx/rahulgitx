### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently learning about multiple technologies with integration to one another.
I've been currently learning and working on:
* Ansible
* Docker
* Kubernetes
* Openshift
* Jenkins
* AWS

All the practicals related to these are being done on RHEL8. 
Apart from these I'm also learning ML and done projects on Hadoop.
